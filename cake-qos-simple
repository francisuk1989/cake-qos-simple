# author: Lynx (OpenWrt forum)

# This simple shell script:
# 1) sets up an intermediate functional block for use with wan ingress (ifb-wan); and
# 2) mirrors packets from wan ingress to ifb-wan having restored DSCPs from the conntracks
# 3) sets up cake on wan egress (for upload) and on ifb-wan (for download)

# This facilitates the optional use of the diffserv functionality in cake for improving qos when
# bandwidth is contrained is contrained by leveraging the connection trability in Linux. 

# To make use of this optional diffserv functionality, DSCPs must be: 
# a) written to packets on upload by LAN clients or route; and
# b) written to conntracks on upload for restoration on download

# Proper operation can be evaluated using 'tcpdump -i ifb-wan -v' to inspect TOS values and by using
# 'tc -s qdisc show dev wan' and 'tc -s qdisc show dev ifb-wan' to inspect the tinning in cake
